-i used the join function to find out which albums were done by various artists-
SELECT Name, Title FROM artists
INNER JOIN albums

SELECT Name FROM artists
WHERE Name LIKE 'A%'; 

-i wanted the names of customers in brazil-
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country FROM customers

INNER JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

-here i wanted to see which employees are managers of any kind-
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title, Phone, Email FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Manager%' ;

-i wanted to see invoice from in 2010-
SELECT * FROM invoices

SELECT MAX(UnitPrice) FROM invoice_items;
SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) FROM invoice_items; 
SELECT ROUND(0.99, 1) FROM invoice_items;

CASE
    WHEN Milliseconds >300000 THEN 'Long'
    WHEN Milliseconds >150000 THEN 'Middle'
    ELSE 'Short'
