/* Create table about the people and what they do here */
CREATE TABLE famous_person (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, job TEXT);
INSERT INTO famous_person VALUES (1, "Anthony Padilla", "Youtuber");
INSERT INTO famous_person VALUES (2, "Ian Hecox", "Youtuber");
INSERT INTO famous_person VALUES (3, "Ryan Higa", "Youtuber");

CREATE TABLE channel (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT );
INSERT INTO channel VALUES (1, "Smosh");
INSERT INTO channel VALUES (2, "Smosh");
INSERT INTO channel VALUES (3, "NigaHiga");

-I have listed some of my favorite famous people, Youtubers and created a separate table with their channels- 
SELECT * FROM famous_person;
SELECT * FROM channel;

-basic join that almost gave me what i wanted to see- 
SELECT * FROM famous_person JOIN channel ON famous_person.id = channel.id;

-better join that gave me exactly what i wanted to see- 
SELECT famous_person.name, famous_person.job, channel.name FROM famous_person JOIN channel ON famous_person.id = channel.id;
